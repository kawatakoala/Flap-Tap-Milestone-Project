My own personal take on the famous/infamous game Flappy Bird
This was my first big project using vanilla Javascript

How to play:

Using the up arrow key, make Dumbo fly through each safe zone in the sky. The safe zones are distinctively marked rainbow sections. The objective of the game is to pass through as many safe zones as you can and achieve getting the highest score. Beware Dumbo is a bit heavy, so for those higher safe zones, make sure to really flap those ears! 

Inspiration for the game: My inspiration for the game was “flappy bird”, but with a Disney twist. I loved the movie Dumbo and decided it would be a fun take on the famous game. Music was included from the 1941 Disney film once you get through a certain number of gates.
